# The genetic mechanism of heterosis utilization in maize improvement

This publication discusses the Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide and serves as a model for heterosis research. The genetic mechanism of heterosis utilization in maize improvement has been widely studied, leading to the development of hybrid seed production as a successful breeding strategy. This review summarizes the current understanding of the genetic basis of heterosis in maize, focusing on key mechanisms such as dominance, overdominance, epistasis, and genomic imprinting. Additionally, recent advances in molecular and genomic technologies have provided new insights into the complex genetic networks underlying heterosis in maize, offering opportunities for further improvement of this important crop.
It contains  genotypes and  markers.
